Originally a small experiment web app to host a battlebox splitter application for Magic the Gathering, this app is currently the main domain of roqb.me, containing pages about me, Robert Hosler as well as two apps.  One for drafting a cube with another user and another for splitting a battlebox, the original intention of this app.
