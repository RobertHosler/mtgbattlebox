NOTES

--20190902--
babel added to compile es6 code within /server to /.compile using source maps for debugging.

copied index.js to server folder to allow it to be converted from es6 using babel
index.js at the root renamed as index---legacy.js should be removed when no longer needed for reference

debugging settings configured to work with vscode

changed Draft.public to Draft.common - public is a reserved word so its best practice to avoid it.

Added draftCards method to Draft module to be shared among draft types

Converted Winston to es6 module

Pancake.js (contains php) moved to php folder.  Php code is from another drafting app I wrote in php.

Tweeks to stacked card css
