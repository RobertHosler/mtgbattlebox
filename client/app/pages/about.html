            Why hello there. Thank you for visiting my website.
        </p>

        <p>
            My name is Robert Hosler and I'm a web developer, gamer, and sometimes artist. I created this website to share
            apps
            with my friends, show off some of my old artwork, and generally just craft my own little place here on the web.
        </p>

            I'm originally from the suburbs of Harrisburg and attended Central Dauphin High School (2009) where I was a member of the school choir.
            My next 4 years were spent at Lebanon Valley College (class of 2013), where I double majored in Computer Science and Studio Art, a 
            combination which encouraged me to strech my creativity and challenge me in a variety of ways. Since college I've been working for Highmark Inc, in the
            dental division supporting United Concordia Dental Insurance. Much of my work has been on My Dental Benefits, a web
            application which allows members to view there claims and benefits information. In 2017 I moved to Pittsburgh
            after my lovely girlfriend Jenny moved there for grad school. Now we live together here with two cats.

            I am passionate about solving interesting problems with creative solutions. This is something I love about gaming, programming, and 
            design. I believe that when we are given the bounds to work in and problems to solve, that is when play begins. My experience 
            in development has been mostly enterprise Java web apps using the JSF framework and Twitter Bootstrap, but here on this site I 
            am exploring other varieties of ways to interact with the web.  The web apps I develop here are all open source and can be viewed
            at my <a href="https://github.com/RobertHosler/" target="_blank">github</a>.

            My relationship with art began almost by accident. In high school I wanted to take a computer design course, but
            it
            ended up being filled with students who received priority. Rather than take a study hall I decided to try a
            drawing
            and painting course. This course ended up challenging us each week to create a unique sketch based on a theme
            each
            week. This is something that really captured my imagination and something I really miss about my high school art
            classes. When I went to college I wanted to keep taking art classes and asked if a double major was even
            possible
            since there would be no overlapping coursework. We made it happen. Please visit my art page to see some of my
            favorite creations.

            In the 8th grade we had to make nametags for our seats in one of my classes. For some reason I didn't like
            simple Rob anymore.
            It felt too short and uninteresting to me. I added a q to my name as a random letter that wouldn't make much
            sense to pronounce, after all q rarely occurs in english without a u, so what does a q in Roqb even mean? I had
            full intention of trying other letters or locations in my name to see if those fit better, x came to mind as
            another strange letter. But, q after the o was the first one I tried, and it stuck. I liked it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years people have tried to pronounce the q and questioned its usage. I always thought I'd leave it
            behind, and in some ways I have. I rarely spell my name like this at work for example to avoid confusion, but I
            actively have to think to not spell my name this way, its become second nature after spelling it this ways for
            many years.

        <p>Would this really be a website without links to social media?  Admittedly, I am not particularly active on social media, but you can find me at these places nonetheless.</p>
